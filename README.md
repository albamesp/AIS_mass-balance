# AIS Mass Balance Data Product

Antarctic Ice Sheet Mass Balance data product. The datasets have been produced by researchers at the University of Bristol within the Resolving Antarctic ice mass TrEndS (RATES) project.

Results from this project have been published in [Martín-Español and others (2016). Spatial and temporal Antarctic Ice Sheet mass trends, glacio-isostatic adjustment, and surface processes from a joint inversion of satellite altimeter, gravity, and GPS data. _Journal of Geophysical Research_ 121(2), pp 182--200.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JF003550/full) 

The website https://albamesp.github.io/AIS_mass-balance/ will feature interactive visualisations of the dataset
